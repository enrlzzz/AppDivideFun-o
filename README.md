# Java Division Function

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates how to perform a basic division operation using a dedicated method. The application uses a `Scanner` within the `div` function to handle user input, perform the division, and display the result.

This is an excellent starting point for learning about organizing code into reusable functions and using user input with the `Scanner` class. Note that since the inputs are read as integers, the division will result in a whole number, truncating any decimal part.
